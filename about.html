        <h3>Ghost Batteries</h3>
        <p>Our story begins in the City of Sarnia at Lambton College.</p>
        <p>A young person named Cassper was assigned a project about batteries, 
         the project was to design a database and website for a battery company! 
         Immediately, Cassper said "This is about to be the most annoying project ever" 
         and she was right. Cassper came up with "Ghost Batteries" a company that 
         sells recycled reusable batteries because why not. 
         AND THATS THE STORY OF GHOST BATTERIES</p>
